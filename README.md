## Data analysis exercise information sheet

You have been provided with two data sets (.csv format).

Data set **applicants.csv** contains information collected about job applicants applying to one or more job positions at a specified organization. Each row corresponds to information on an individual applying to a single job position. The fields and their definitions are listed in Table 1.

Data set **hires.csv** contains information collected about a subset of these applicants that were hired to fill a job position at one of the specified organizations. Each row corresponds to an individual employee. Table 2 lists the fields contained in this data set. Note that the **hires.csv** data may contain individuals not appearing in the **applicants.csv** data. This just means that some hires were made without the data contained in **applicants.csv** being collected for these hires.

The field *User_Id* is contained in both files and can be used to join applicants to their associated hire information. Note that some of the individuals contained in the **hires.csv** file are currently employed, thus the stated tenure length represents tenure length at the time of the most recent data extract.  A few individuals have tenure lengths that are not known, i.e. their tenure_length value is missing.

### Instructions

Clone this repo. Use the two data sets, and whatever tools you are most comfortable with, to answer the following questions to the best of your ability.

1. Data Exploration

    1. Which organizations have the greatest applicant-to-hire ratio?

    2. Which organizations have the greatest challenge with attrition in the first 3 months of employment?

2. Data Analysis

    3. Do 6 month attrition rates vary significantly across different job categories?

    4. How does the type of device used to take the questionnaire impact an applicantâ€™s tenure length, if at all?

3. Predictive Modeling

    5. Develop one or more models that can be used to predict whether an applicant to one of the given organizations and job positions is likely to remain employed for less than 6 months, between 6 and 12 months, or greater than 12 months. Provide justification for the modeling methodology(s) you use,  discussion on any algorithm tuning you may have done, any assumptions you have made, as well as steps you may have taken to address potential issues in the data.  

    6. Using one or more methods of your choosing, evaluate the performance of the model and provide an assessment of whether your model(s) would be useful for making hiring recommendations to HR managers at the specified organizations.

Please submit a brief writeup (3-4 pages at most) that summarizes your findings in a form that could be understood by a non-technical colleague, along with the code used to conduct your analysis, via   e-mail to [bonnie@peggedsoftware.com](mailto:bonnie@peggedsoftware.com). The report can be submitted in the format of your choosing, e.g. Word/PPT,  Google Doc/Slides,  PDF,  R markdown report, Jupyter notebook, whatever works, as long as it is readable and contains explanations of problem/approach/summary in English (not just code).

The results of your analysis will be assessed based on the following criteria:

Report:

* Readability

* Statement of assumptions and methods used

* Appropriateness of the approach(s)

* Discussion of results

Code

* Structure

* Readability (includes some basic documentation)

* Executability (can we get it to run?) Provide a small set of instructions for how to run your code, don't use hard-coded paths, and specify what packages need to be installed 

We are not necessarily interested in having you spend most of your  time coming up with the absolute best predictive model for the stated problem. Our interest is more in gaining an understanding of how you approach different types of questions, i.e. your analysis *process*. We suggest that you spend no more than half of your time on the first two questions, saving sufficient time to work through Question 3.
